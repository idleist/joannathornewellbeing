                    <p class="serviceText">
                      This workshop is aimed at children aged 5 to 12 years old and their parents.  During the workshop I teach breathing and meditation techniques using visualisation.  Parents will learn how to support their children in practising the relaxation techniques we cover in the session.  We discuss our "inner critic" which is the voice in our head that causes low self-esteem and lack of confidence.  We learn how to quiet that voice and have confidence in ourselves through craft activities and stories.  
                      The session is about 90 minutes long and includes refreshments at the end where I can answer any questions.

                    <p class="serviceText">
                      Being a teenager is a tricky time for most people with problems like peer pressure, body changes, friendship issues and exam stress.  This can lead to feelings of anxiety and loneliness.
                      During this group mindfulness session I will lead parents and their teenagers through discussions about the types of anxiety we all experience to promote a sense of belonging among the young people.  
                      We will learn breathing techniques and mindful visualisations to help with general relaxation and provide coping mechanisms.

                    Whether we agree or disagree with the SATs testing, our children go through a very stressful time with the preparation for the test week and the actual tests themselves.
                    This workshop is for parent and child to learn coping strategies for the difficult weeks of preparation and during the tests themselves. 
                    I will teach you breathing techniques and visualisations to calm nerves and aid focus, giving parents the tools to support their child and the child the confidence to proceed without stress.

                    During the festive season it is easy to lose track of your own feelings and emotions and by Christmas Day we are often exhausted and run down.  This mindful session will unwind you, bring you back to the present and leave your mind free to deal with all the plans and preparations you need to undertake.  
                    Come and join me, sitting by a real fire and lose yourself in total relaxation during a warming visualisation.  Followed by festive refreshments.
